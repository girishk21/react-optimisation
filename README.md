# React optimisation

Welcome to this challenge. We'll be working on optimising the loading performance of the app.

The app has three pages, each loaded with it's own features.

Currently the App loades **800KB** gziped, or **3MB** raw for the initial paint.

For sure we can do better than this. How can we bring down this numbers significantly and bring the content to our users quickly.
